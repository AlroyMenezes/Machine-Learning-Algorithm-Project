Project Title: Detecting Fake vs. Genuine Instagram Accounts Using Machine Learning.
GitHub - AlroyMenezes/Machine-Learning-Algorithm

### Description:
This project aims to detect fake social media accounts using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing various features extracted from social media profiles, including profile picture presence, account privacy settings, follower counts, and more, the project explores the effectiveness of different classification algorithms in distinguishing between genuine and fake accounts.

### Key Features:
- Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Comprehensive exploration of the dataset, including handling missing values, visualizing distributions, and identifying outliers. Preprocessing steps such as standardization and normalization are implemented to prepare the data for modeling.
- Model Building and Evaluation: Utilization of multiple classification algorithms, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVM, for predicting fake accounts. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC are used to assess model performance.
- Further Analysis and Improvement: Suggestions for improving model performance, including feature engineering, feature selection, handling imbalanced data, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring ensemble methods. Interpretability techniques are also recommended to provide insights into model predictions.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to replicate the analysis and experiments.
4. Experiment with different preprocessing techniques, algorithms, and hyperparameters to further improve model performance.
5. Share your feedback, suggestions, and contributions to enhance the project collaboratively.
